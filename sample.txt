4 ... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .	
4 The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday .	
3 But on the whole , you 're gonna like this movie .	
1 Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .	
4 This is a superior horror flick .	
3 Despite the film 's bizarre developments , Hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character 's gripping humanity .	
3 He 's the scariest guy you 'll see all summer .	
3 Significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition .	
0 It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .	
3 Craig Bartlett and director Tuck Tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters .
